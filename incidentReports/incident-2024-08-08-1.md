The alerting system efficiently notified us of the issue and the on call team immediately resolved the problem within a reasonable period of time. Using the issue reporting URL provided by JWT Headquarters the failure immediately resolved.

We need to schedule a meeting with JWT Headquarters to better understand what the failure was and what they are going to do in order to mitigate this from happening in the future.

# Action items

1. Meet with JWT Headquarters to do a post mortem.
